# The Cloudflare credentials (i.e. api token and zone id) can be 
# obtained from your Cloudflare account online. The record information
# (i.e. id, name, type) can be obtained by first specifying the 
# Cloudflare credentials and zone id here and then running 
# 'cloudflare_ddns list'. This will query your Cloudflare account and download 
# record information for the specified zone into a log file in the directory 
# the script is executed from.
#
# KNOWN ISSUE: Zones with a large number of records may not download
# completely because Cloudflare paginates the results but the cloudflare_ddns 
# script doesn't support pagination. You will have to manually query if this
# becomes a problem. It may also be possible to obtain record information 
# directly from the web portal, but it wasn't obvious to me where.

# DEPRECATION WARNING
# Cloudflare continues to support auth via email and api key, but 
# they are encouraging the use of "tokens" for API access. These can be
# created through your Cloudflare account online. Once created, you can specify
# your token via the CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN setting.
